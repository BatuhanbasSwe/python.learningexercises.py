# My Python Portfolio & Coding Practice

Welcome! This repository is my personal archive for Python projects and exercises. 🚀

As a **Software Engineering student (2nd Year)**, I use this space to improve my coding skills. It includes everything from basic algorithms to Data Science and Web Automation projects.

**File:** `deneme2.py` (Main code file)

## 📂 What is Inside?

I organized my code into different sections to practice specific topics:

### 1. Python Basics & Logic
I practiced important Python concepts here:
* **Advanced Syntax:** Using Decorators, Generators, and Iterators.
* **Error Handling:** Using `try-except` blocks to catch errors.
* **Functions:** Writing clean code with `lambda`, `map`, and `filter`.
* **Regex:** Searching text patterns with Regular Expressions.

### 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
I learned how to design software using classes:
* **Inheritance:** Creating parent and child classes (like `Person` -> `Student`).
* **Projects:** I wrote the logic for a **Quiz App** and a **Bank Account System**.

### 3. Data Analysis & Visualization 📊
I used popular libraries to analyze real data:
* **Pandas & NumPy:** I worked with DataFrames, cleaned missing data (`NaN`), and grouped data for analysis.
* **Real Data:** I analyzed **IMDB Movies**, **NBA Players**, and **YouTube Statistics**.
* **Matplotlib:** I created Bar Charts, Pie Charts, and Histograms to visualize the results.

### 4. Web Automation (Selenium) 🤖
I wrote scripts to control web browsers automatically:
* **Bots:** I created bots to log in and interact with **Instagram** and **GitHub**.
* **Scraping:** I pulled data from websites like IMDB.
